"""Persistence + pure scheduling/progress math for the Tasks tab.

Tasks live in tasks.json (same atomic-write pattern as config.py /
session_history.py). A task's actual work sessions are NOT stored here --
starting a task just calls session_manager.start_session(source="task",
event_id=task["id"], event_title=task["name"]), the same generic mechanism
calendar_scheduler.py already uses for calendar-event-triggered sessions.
That means every completed task session shows up in session_history.json
like any other, and this module's job is to read it back out and turn it
into "minutes worked on task X today" / "how much vacation time has task X
banked" -- no separate log of its own to keep in sync.

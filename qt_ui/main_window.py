# across *all* pages it holds, not just the current one (see _PagesStack
# below) -- and separately, Qt's own QWidgetItemV2 layout-item cache can
# keep serving a stale page's value even after that's fixed. Both of those
# only change what number gets requested; they don't explain why a plain
# title-bar *move* (which should never touch size at all) was applying it.
# A reactive Python-side correction (resizeEvent below) can request the
# right size back, but loses the race: confirmed by logging that whatever
# imposes the oversized height re-fires on literally the next tick,
# undoing the correction within milliseconds, for as long as the drag
# continues.
#
# WM_MOVING is Windows' message for a pure move -- it hands the app a
# mutable RECT for the proposed window position *before* it's applied,
# specifically so the app can adjust it, and WM_ENTERSIZEMOVE/EXITSIZEMOVE
# bracket the whole interactive drag. Capturing the window's actual frame
# size (GetWindowRect -- physical pixels, no logical/physical or
# client/frame conversion needed) once at ENTERSIZEMOVE and re-asserting
# that exact width/height on every subsequent WM_MOVING intercepts
# synchronously, before any size change is ever applied, so there's no
# race to lose -- the window simply cannot resize while being moved.

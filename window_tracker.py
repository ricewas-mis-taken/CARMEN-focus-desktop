# SetForegroundWindow race loses to the app re-asserting itself. Since the
# hard-lock branch below resets last_flagged_process to None right after
# redirecting (so a genuine re-open by the user still counts as a fresh
# violation), a process that never actually leaves foreground was retriggering
# hard_lock_redirect() on *every* poll tick -- each call re-issuing
# SW_MINIMIZE/SetForegroundWindow (visible as the app's window flashing) and
# spawning another lock overlay (visible as several piling up on screen) every
# 1.5s for as long as it stayed stuck. This cooldown limits how often the same
# offending process can be redirected, without touching how often violations

    on_session_end(summary), if given, is called once whenever a session's
    timer runs out naturally (as opposed to being ended manually via the tray
    menu or POST /session/end, which notify their own caller directly). This
    loop calls get_status() every tick specifically so that self-finalization
    happens here even if nothing else (browser extension, lock overlay) is
    polling /status — otherwise a session could expire with no notification
    ever firing.

    tray_icon, if given, gets update_menu() called whenever isActive/isPaused
    changes — pystray's win32 backend only rebuilds its popup menu (and so
    only re-evaluates each MenuItem's `visible` callable) when told to, not
    automatically on every right-click. Without this, the tray's Pause/Resume
    and End Session (Nuclear) items — which are only meant to show up while a
    session is running — would keep showing whatever visibility they had the
    last time update_menu() happened to run, regardless of session state
    changes made elsewhere (the API, a session ending naturally, etc).

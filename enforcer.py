    a system-wide input grab -- that would freeze every other running app
    (any background exe's window, tray flyouts, etc.), not just the
    offending one.

    Built on the Qt main thread via qt_gui_thread.run_on_gui_thread() rather
    than constructed here directly -- Qt widgets, like the Tk widgets this
    replaced, may only be touched from the thread that owns the
    QApplication (this app's main thread; see main.py), and this function
    runs on window_tracker's polling thread instead.

    Guarded two ways against ever getting stuck open: the overlay's own
    tick-driven close, and a backup timer -- see qt_ui/enforcer_overlay.py.

    offending_process_name, when known, adds a "Whitelist" button -- lets
    the user let that exe through for the rest of the session without
    ending hard/soft lock enforcement entirely, same as the "Pick Apps to
    Whitelist" tray flow, just reachable from the moment of redirect
    itself.
